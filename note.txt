9. You can simply change the following codes in your style.css and it will work.

from this

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

to this

@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
Rest of the codes remain same. Only the above needs to be changed and you're good to go. This usually happens in tailwind v3.
